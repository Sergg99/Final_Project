# Final Project Database Creation

# Objective
Analysis of the college completion rates and efficiency measures for institutions across the United States based on a dataset compiled by Jonathan Ortiz (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/college-completion-and-efficiency-measures-for-u).

# Softwares
- Quick DBD (https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/)
- PostgreSQL and pgAdmin 4

# Analysis
In order to analyze the HR data, an Employee Database was created based on the entity relationship diagram, shown below. 

The Employee database was created from the following four (4) source csv tables: 
- cc_institution_details
- cc_institution_grads
- cc_state_sector_details
- cc_state_sector_grads

The code for creation of the Database can be found here: schema.
