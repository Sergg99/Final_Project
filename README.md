The Employee database was created from the following four (4) source tables [archive.zip](https://github.com/kfelds1/Final_Project/blob/6b38d0e19ebf20343cb548641279730aa7440c88/archive.zip): 
- cc_institution_details.csv
- cc_institution_grads.csv
- cc_state_sector_details.csv
- cc_state_sector_grads.csv

The code for creation of the Database can be found here: schema.
