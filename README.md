The topic our team selected is around college completion and efficiency measures for US institutions. There are several factors that impact a student's ability to complete a college education. These include gender, race, and other external factors that have historically been known to causes inequities among specific groups. By analyzing the data, we will be able to assess the institution's performance and determine how resources, specifically financial aid may help improve a student's success. Our team selected this topic because we are interested in exploring how motivating factors such as financial aid and early interventions, help provide more access to students in need, and ultimately improve students chances of completing a college education.
