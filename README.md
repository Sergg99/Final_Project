## Topic and Reasoning:

Topic 1: School Neighborhood Poverty Estimates, 2017-18
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/school-neighborhood-poverty-estimates-2017-18-a7e12
Dataset uses public school point locations developed by NCES to estimate (along with household economic data from the Census Bureauâ€™s American Community Survey (ACS)) the income-to-poverty ratio for neighborhoods around school buildings. It looks at the economic condition of the neighborhood around a school that may impact schools, and, looks at conditions at schools that may impact local neighborhoods. The school neighborhood poverty estimates provide an additional indicator to help identify these local conditions.
