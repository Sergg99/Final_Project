## Topic and Reasoning:

Topic 1: School Neighborhood Poverty Estimates, 2017-18

https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/school-neighborhood-poverty-estimates-2017-18-a7e12

This dataset uses public school point locations developed by NCES to estimate (along with household economic data from the Census Bureauâ€™s American Community Survey (ACS)) the income-to-poverty ratio for neighborhoods around school buildings. It looks at the economic condition of the neighborhood around a school that may impact schools, and, looks at conditions at schools that may impact local neighborhoods. The school neighborhood poverty estimates provide an additional indicator to help identify these local conditions.

Topic 2: Public School Locations

https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/public-school-locations-current-d9c4f

This dataset provides student demographics, number of teachers, school grade span, and various other administrative conditions at public schools in the US. The CCD program annually collects administrative and fiscal data about all public schools, school districts, and state education agencies in the United States. Gives the locations of these public schools. These two datasets could provide some correlations between poverty estimates and school localities.
